Homemade Vanilla Bean Ice Cream is the essence of Summer. Making vanilla ice cream from scratch is simple and once you have the recipe down the creations you make with it are endless â€“ try Cherry Pie Ice Cream, mix in ground nuts for pistachio or hazelnut ice cream, or swirl in some whiskey caramel sauce for a real treat!

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
    <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>1 cup sugar</li>
    <li>Pinch salt</li>
    <li>Vanilla beans</li>
    <li>5 large egg yolks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Get out a large bowl and a mesh strainer and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a medium sauce pan, bring the milk, cream, 1/2 of the sugar (1/2 cup), and salt to a boil (keep a close eye on it so it doesn't boil over).</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar.</li>
    <li>Once the milk is boiling, lower the heat to medium low and add in the vanilla bean seeds or extract. Use a measuring cup to transfer 1/4 cup of the hot milk to the egg yolks and whisk to combine. Do this one more time (tempering the eggs and bringing them to a warm temperature) then add in all of the egg yolk mixture into the sauce pan. Stir constantly for about 5 minutes, scraping the sides and bottom of the pan to prevent sticking. The custard should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon when it's ready. Do not allow the custard to boil.</li>
    <li>Pour the custard into the prepared strainer set over a large bowl. Cover the top of the custard with plastic wrap (literally on top of the liquid to prevent a skin from forming). Set the custard in the fridge to cool for 1 hour. </li>
    <li>Once custard is cool, pour into a ice cream maker and churn according to the manufactuer directions (usually about 25 minutes). Transfer the ice cream to an air tight, freezer safe container and place in the freezer.  Freeze for 2-4 hours before serving. </li>
</ol>
